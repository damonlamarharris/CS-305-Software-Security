Client Overview
     Artemis Financial specializes in developing personalized financial plans for customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company's operations heavily rely on the secure handling of sensitive client financial information.

Issue to Address
     Artemis Financial seeks to modernize its operations and enhance the security of its web application. Specifically, the company requires secure communication protocols for data transfers through its public web interface. Protecting client data and financial information is a top priority, necessitating the implementation of advanced software security measures.

Software Requirements
1.	File Verification: To secure data transfers, add a file verification step to the web application.
2.	Checksum Implementation: Incorporate a checksum-based data verification mechanism to confirm the integrity of transferred files.
3.	Secure Communication: Integrate secure coding protocols to protect sensitive client data and financial transactions.
4.	Production-Quality Application: Deliver an updated, integrated web application that meets modern security standards.

Evaluation of Software Security Work
What Was Done Well:
A significant achievement was the effective use of the pom.xml file to integrate and manage a suppression file for vulnerability suppression. The Maven dependency-check plugin was used to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Low-priority vulnerabilities and false positives are suppressed through a suppression file, allowing time to focus on addressing high-priority risks. This proactive approach streamlined the security process and ensured the most critical vulnerabilities were resolved.
Why Secure Coding is Important:
Secure coding is essential for reducing the risk of exploitation, safeguarding sensitive client data, and protecting the organization from potential breaches. Unaddressed vulnerabilities can result in unauthorized data access, financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions. Secure coding practices ensure applications are resilient against attacks, preserving their integrity and trustworthiness.


Value of Software Security to a Company’s Well-Being:
1.	Client Trust: Enhanced security reassures clients that their financial data is protected, strengthening trust and loyalty.
2.	Regulatory Compliance: Meeting security standards ensures compliance with legal and industry regulations, avoiding fines and penalties.
3.	Risk Mitigation: Reducing vulnerabilities minimizes the risk of breaches, saving time for incident response and recovery.
4.	Operational Efficiency: A secure application prevents downtime caused by security incidents, ensuring consistent business operations.
5.	Competitive Advantage: Commitment to security enhances the company’s reputation, attracting security-conscious clients.

Challenging Aspect
     One of the most challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was determining which vulnerabilities to suppress in the suppression file generated by the dependency check. The tool found a of issues, including false positives, low-priority concerns, and valid threats. Analysis of each flagged item was required to ensure no critical vulnerabilities were mistakenly ignored.


How Layers of Security Were Increased
1.	Suppression File Integration:
Using the pom.xml file with the Maven dependency-check plugin, non-critical vulnerabilities were suppressed, allowing the team to focus on high-priority risks without unnecessary distractions.
2.	Checksum for Data Verification:
A checksum mechanism was added to verify data integrity during transfers, ensuring that files were not tampered with during transmission. This safeguarded against data corruption and man-in-the-middle attacks.
3.	Secure Communication Protocols:
HTTPS and encryption protocols were implemented to protect client communications from eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
4.	Dependency Updates:
Libraries and dependencies were updated regularly to avoid vulnerabilities in outdated components, reducing the application’s attack surface.

Steps to Ensure Functionality and Security
•	Testing: The application was rigorously tested to validate functionality. Running it as a Spring Boot application confirmed the server’s security.
•	Secure Coding Standards: Used OWASP guidelines to address common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
•	Input Validation: Ensured all user inputs were sanitized and validated before processing.
•	Encryption: Applied TLS encryption to secure data transmission.
Automated Vulnerability Scanning:
•	Integrated tools like the Maven dependency-check plugin to continuously monitor vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
•	Configured suppression files in pom.xml to manage false positives and low-priority vulnerabilities efficiently.

Examples of Work to Showcase to Future Employers
1.	Updated Application Code: Secure communication mechanisms were integrated into the application.
2.	Dependency Management: Demonstrated proficiency in managing dependencies, assessing vulnerabilities, and resolving risks using Maven.
3.	Refactored Codebase: Delivered a refactored codebase with improved maintainability, security measures, and test cases verifying functionality.
4.	Risk Prioritization and Mitigation: Showed the ability to assess security vulnerabilities, prioritize risks, and apply appropriate mitigation techniques to protect software.
